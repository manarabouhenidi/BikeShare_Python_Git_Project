# BikeShare_Python_Git_Project
This Project is Made for the NanoDegree Program with Udacity. In this project I created a new repo, brunch it, clone it, added the cvs files in gitignore
During the Nano Degree Program with Udacity I have learned about Numpy, Pandas, Advance python.

In this project, I wrote a Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Interactive Experience The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:

Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington? Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all? (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June? (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday? The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which you'll do data analysis. After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.
